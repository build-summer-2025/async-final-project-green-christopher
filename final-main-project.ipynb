    "Analyzing the data, it appears that the first set of games that we have a recording of for this data set is since 1993. Moreover, I also found it interesting the the amount of matches that were recorded and played throughout the most was around 2022. The trend of the matches played themselves continued to grow since 1993 until around 2019. Moving onto 2020, the amount of matches that were played dropped significantly. This almost matched the amount of recorded matches in 1993, only being a couple hundred off. The reason for this is because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought lockdown to the entire world and therefore, not many games were able to be played. Nonetheless, at the end of the graph the trend is starting to go back up, and many games were played throughout 2021 due to the lack of games there were the year before and to also prepare for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The most games that were played were between 2005 and 2015, and it appears that the most matches played was in 2019/2021. "
